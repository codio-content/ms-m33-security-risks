Many people think that when a file or information is deleted from a computer that it is gone. However, advanced users can find data that has been "deleted" until the computer writes over the data. If a person is selling their computer, for example, they may want to run a process that will write over every space in memory and disc space on the computer in order to make sure that any private information previously stored on the computer is not accessible by the new owners.
