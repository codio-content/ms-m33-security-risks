A password is the first line of defense against someone looking to steal your data. Having a weak password is like leaving your front door unlocked while you aren't home. It looks closed just like all of the other homes, but if a thief comes through and tries each house, yours is the one where he will be able to walk right in and take whatever he would like.

The same is true for a weak password. Easily guessable passwords make for easy targets when a hacker is trying to get into any kind of accounts. 

"Easily guessable" passwords are those that include:
- your name
- your username
- the word "password"
- consecutive numbers, such as 1234
- any dictionary word
- all uppercase, all lowercase, or all numerical characters

Hackers often have bots that can go through and try every word in the dictionary to try to guess passwords. This is called the brute-force method of hacking.

It is important to develop secure passwords for every account that are different because if one website is hacked and your username and password is stolen, you do not want the hackers to be able to use that login information to access every site you have an account on. For this reason, we need secure, unique passwords that are easy to remember.
