In order to protect every account from brute-force hacking attempts, passwords should:

- Be different for every account
- Contain a mixture of uppercase, lowercase, and numerical characters
- Be easy to remember
- Not include your name or your username
- Not be a word from a dictionary

One way to create a highly secure password is to create a sentence that is easy to remember and can be adapted for every account. Then use this sentence to create a passphrase by taking the first letter of each word and using numbers where applicable.


For example, one such sentence may be "My number one favorite website is ALWAYS [blank]" where you fill in the blank with the website you are creating a password for.

So, for your yahoo.com account, the sentence would be "My number one favorite website is ALWAYS yahoo". You can take the first letter of each word and replace the phrase "number one" with "#1" to get the passphrase:
M#1fwiAy

If you were also setting up a google.com account, your sentence would then be "My number one favorite website is ALWAYS google", which would give the passphrase:

M#1fwiAg

These passwords are easy to remember because you are remembering a sentence, and they vary slightly from site to site, so if your information from one site was compromised, the hackers would not be able to use it to log in to other websites.
